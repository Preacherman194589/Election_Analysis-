# Colorado Congressional Election Audit

## Overview of Election Audit 
The Colorado Board of Election audited several key issues in the Colorado Congressional race. The team of auditors looked at Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe counties. To validate the audit, they had to focus on three key issues:

1. What is the total popular vote within the congressional seats
2. What is the percentage of that vote? 
3. Who is the winner?

The Board also asked if the audit team could use Python and similar software to reach a more precise outcome. The Board stated that if the process is beneficial, they will look more into the future of using such a format and method for future local, congressional, and senatorial races. 

## Election Audit Results

## Election Audit Summary 

The audit determines that certain counties had a larger turnout than others. What makes this number more concerning is the high number of turnouts compared to other counties, such as Denver and Arapahoe. There are two additional ways the Board of Elections can modify its election process? 

 1.	Compare the number of registered voters to actual voters.
 2. Precinct breakdown will show voters based on gender, race, age, etc. 

Overall, I believe that the process will work and benefit the Board.
